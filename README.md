# ocfuzz (Version 0.1.2)
This is a flexible script allowing the user to test for valid subdomains / endpoints, specifically for those hosted on OpenShift.

The command line flags can be specified to check other sites as well. Use --flag to specify a string to look for in the body of the HTTP response to indicate failure.

Use the -h or --help flag to list the command line options.

This script has been successfully tested on Linux, Windows, and both Python 2 and Python 3.
